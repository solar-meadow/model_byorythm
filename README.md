Biorhythm theory suggests that our physical, mental, and emotional states are influenced by biological cycles which repeat every 23 days, 28 days, and 33 days. Peak performance in any area of life is determined by biorhythms and one is most likely to be successful in any endeavor if it is well-timed.
